UCB Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 9 SQL Challenge

## Installation

Software Postgres is being used to write the code, and to generate the results, and the CSV datasets are provided by UC Berkeley.


## Description

This is the Module 9 challenge for the UC Berkeley Data Analyticd Boot Camp.

In this challenge, we are a new data engineer at a fictional company Pewlett Hackard, and our task is to do a research project about the people who worked at the compay during the 1980s and 1990s. All we have remaining are 6 CSV files. With the datasets, we are to design the tables to hold the data from the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.
